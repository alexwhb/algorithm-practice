# algorithm-practice
just some code to help my practice some algorithms.

I will be adding new algorithems as I learn them. for now I'm writing in python, but I might switch to other languages. 


##algorithem's I'd like to implement: 

#### Graph Algorithems: 
  * A*
  
#### Sort Algorithems: 
  * Quikc sort
  * Merg sort
  * Heapsort
  * Insertion sort
  * Selection sort
  * Bubble sort
  * Timsort

#### DSP Algorithems: 
  * Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
  

#### Some reasources:
