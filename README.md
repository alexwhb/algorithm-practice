# algorithm-practice
just some code to help my practice some algorithms.

I will be adding new algorithems as I learn them. for now I'm writing in python, but I might switch to other languages. 


## Algorithem's I'd like to implement: 

#### Graph Algorithems: 
  - [x] A* 
  - [x] Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm

#### Sort Algorithems: 
  - [ ] Quick sort
  - [x] Merg sort
  - [x] Heapsort
  - [x] Insertion sort
  - [x] Selection sort
  - [x] Bubble sort
  - [ ] Timsort

#### DSP Algorithems: 
  - [ ] DFT
  - [ ] CFT
  

#### Search Algorithems
  - [ ] Principal Variation Search


#### Miscellaneous
  - [ ] Elo ranking system
 
#### Data Structures:
  - [x] Linked List
  - [x] Stack
  - [x] Queue
  - [x] Binary Tree
  - [ ] BDD ( binary direction diagram )

 
#### Learning Algorithms:
  - [ ] C4.5
  - [ ] k-Means
  - [ ] Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - [ ] Apriori
  - [ ] Expectation Maximization (EM)
  - [ ] PageRank
  - [ ] AdaBoost
  - [ ] k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
  - [ ] Naive Bayes
  - [ ] Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
